PulseGuard is a heart-rate monitoring system with automated escalation, developed as a Final Year Project for the BSc (Hons) in Software Development.

The application continuously monitors the user’s heart rate using a Samsung smartwatch running Wear OS. In the event of a detected cardiac event, PulseGuard can automatically escalate the situation by notifying preconfigured emergency contacts through the companion mobile application if the user is unresponsive.

The system is designed to support proactive health monitoring while prioritising reliability, usability, and timely intervention. A companion mobile app allows users to configure emergency contacts, review historical heart-rate data, and manage alert preferences.

This project focuses on:
- Real-time heart-rate monitoring on Wear OS
- Automated anomaly detection and escalation
- Reliable communication between smartwatch and mobile devices
- User-centred design for health-critical applications

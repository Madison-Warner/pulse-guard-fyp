PulseGuard is a mobile and smartwatch health monitoring system designed to track vital signs in real time and provide proactive alerts to support user wellbeing. It is developed as a Final Year Project for the BSc (Hons) in Software Development in Munter Technological University.

The system consists of a mobile application and a companion smartwatch application that work together to monitor key health metrics such as heart rate and activity levels in real time. PulseGuard aims to support proactive health awareness by presenting clear insights, historical trends, and timely alerts to the user.

The project focuses on:
- Seamless communication between mobile and wearable devices
- Real-time data collection and synchronisation
- User-friendly visualisation of health metrics
- Scalable and maintainable software architecture

This repository follows a monorepo structure, containing both the mobile and smartwatch applications, along with any shared components.
